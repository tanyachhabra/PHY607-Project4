Overview

This Python script provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing atomic properties and electronic configurations using the pymatgen library. The script includes two main classes: ElectronicConfiguration and AtomicProperties, which offer various methods to visualize and calculate atomic characteristics.

Dependencies

NumPy

Matplotlib

Pymatgen


Installation

Pymatgen can be installed using the following command in bash:

pip install Pymatgen

Features

1. Electronic Configuration Visualization

The ElectronicConfiguration class allows you to:

Create a polar plot of an atom's electronic structure

Visualize electron distribution across different shells

Customize the plot with color and styling

2. Atomic Properties Calculation

The AtomicProperties class provides methods to:

Calculate shielding constant (Ïƒ)

Compute effective nuclear charge (Z_eff)

Estimate atomic radius

In-class exercise

1. Make a polar plot for any element with a stable oxidization state, for example: Fe2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, Al3+, etc

2. Choose the list of elements from the table provided and put it in the atoms array in the format:
 atoms= ["Na", "Mg"]

  Write this list in the increasing value of atomic number. 

  Also write the corresponding observed values of atomic radii from the table. Use this to write the observed_radii list.

  observed_radii= [2.17, 1.68]  

3. Write the code to get the plot for atomic radii versus atomic number in the plot_atomic_number_versus_radii function. Plot for both the experimental and calculated values.
